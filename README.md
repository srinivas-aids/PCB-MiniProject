## AIM :
Design and develop a PCB board for any specific application.
## Algorithm:
##STEP 1 :Draw a neat schematic by following the standard rules.

##STEP 2: Develop the PCB layout.

STEP 3: Generate GCODE using CopperCAM

STEP 4:Manufacture the PCB board using PCB prototyping machine.

STEP 5: Attach the schematic diagram, PCB layout, CopperCAM output, GCODE and image of the manufactured PCB with the submission.
